Thoughts and Ramblings
-------------
* grunt is glorified xml - 100% declarative
* versioning and profiles are a mess
* Build dependency management is a mess - should be a [Directed Graph](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph)
* Should be concurrent by default
* There is more to build than tasks!
 
TODO
-------------
[ ] profiles
[ ] versioning
[ ] releasing
